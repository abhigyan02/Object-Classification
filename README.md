# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains a Python script for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how to use Keras to create a deep learning model for image classification.

## About the Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The goal is to classify these images into their respective categories using a CNN model.

## Project Structure

- `.py`: The main Python script that defines, compiles, trains, and evaluates the CNN model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and how to use the script.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow and Keras libraries
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for experimentation)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhigyan02/cifar10-cnn.git
